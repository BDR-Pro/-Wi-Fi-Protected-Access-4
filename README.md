# WPA 4: A Secure Authentication Method Using ECC and Hashing for Wi-Fi Networks

Your idea appears to be a method for securely authenticiating a client to an access point (AP) in a network using public-key cryptography and hashing. Let's break down the steps you've outlined to understand the process and its security implications:

1. **Client requests connection using a public ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) key**: This step implies that the client shares its public key with the access point. Public-key cryptography enables secure communication in an insecure environment without the need to share a secret key beforehand. Using ECC is efficient and secure, as it provides high security with smaller key sizes compared to other algorithms like RSA.

2. **Access Point encrypts a random word (salt) using the client's public key and sends it back**: The AP generates a random value (salt) and encrypts it with the client's public key. Only the holder of the corresponding private key (in this case, the client) can decrypt this message. This step ensures that the salt is securely transmitted to the client.

3. **Client hashes the combination of the salt and the password, then presumably sends it back to the AP**: The client decrypts the salt using its private key, appends its password to the salt, and then applies the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to this combination. The resulting hash is then sent to the AP.

This process uses elements of asymmetric cryptography and hashing to securely authenticate a client to an AP. However, there are some considerations and potential improvements:

- **Authentication of the AP to the Client**: Your method primarily focuses on the client proving its identity to the AP. In many authentication scenarios, it's also important for the client to verify the identity of the AP to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. This can be achieved through a mutual authentication process.

- **Hash Transmission and Verification**: The method suggests sending the hash of the salt and password back to the AP. For this to work, the AP must have a way to verify the hash, which typically means the AP needs either the original password or a pre-computed hash stored securely. Storing passwords, even in hashed form, requires careful security considerations.

- **Use of SHA-256 for Password Hashing**: While SHA-256 is a secure cryptographic hash function, it is designed for speed and not specifically for password hashing. Password hashing algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 are more suitable because they are designed to be computationally expensive and can be adjusted for increased resistance against brute-force attacks.

- **Replay Attacks**: The scheme should include measures to prevent replay attacks, where an attacker reuses a captured hash to authenticate. This can be mitigated by including a timestamp or nonce in the hash calculation and ensuring the AP checks for freshness.

Your concept is an interesting approach to secure authentication, combining ECC, encryption, and hashing. However, considering the above points can help in refining the approach to ensure it provides robust security against various threats.
